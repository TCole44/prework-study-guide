        <h2>git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project</li>
          <li>use command line to access</li>
          <li>different than regular bash commands, always starts with git</li>
          <li>great for tracking changes locally but github allows us to keep track of projects remotely and collaborate with other using repositories</li>
          <li>repositories are used to store, files that contain code, files that contain other info about the code, ie. a README file, and version history for all files in the repo</li>
          <li>README files- used to pass along useful information to anyone who visits the repository on GitHub</li>
          <li>.md- an extension o indicate a Markdown file, similar to .doc, except we have to use a special syntax for formatting</li>
          <li>code editor(VS Code) used to write, view, and edi our code</li>
          <li>branch- copy or version of the code that can be worked on independently in isolation so development changes do not disrupt other team members who are also working on the code and testing their solutions</li>
          <li>main branch is default branch, we should not be doing any coding in the main branch</li>
          <li>when we creat a new branch to add something new to our project we call it a feature branch</li>
          <li>In the feature branch, we make commits of all the changes we make to the code while working. We add a commit message that is descriptive of what changed in the code, then we push it to our feature branch in the github repo</li>
          <li>PR- Pull Request- used to merge a comparison branch into te base branch</li>
          <li>PR Open- you, other developers, and collaborators on your team can view those changes you made to the code and then comment on it, request changes, and even have a conversation about your changes</li>
          <li>Once PR is approved, you can merge it into the main branch, any new branches will be created from the updated main branch</li>
            <ul>
              <h3>git commands</h3>
                <li>git clone <paste copied SSH value>- clones github repository onto our computer</li>
                <li>git status - check what branch we are currently on</li>
                <li>git checkout -b feature/????? - create a new branch, git precedes every Git statement, checkout moves the working branch to a new branch, -b creates a new branch</li>
                <li>git add -A - add adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area, -A indicates that we want to add all changes</li>
                <li>git commit -m "add ?????" - command with a commit message that describes what the commit contains</li>  
                <li>git pull origin ?????- checks if our local branch is in sync with the base branch in Github, pull receives a branch's modifications into the local environment,origin indicates the source of the pull will be in the Github repo,????? indicates the branch</li>
